# Hytopia Development Kit

A dynamic Docker-based development environment for Hytopia game development. This toolkit provides an automated setup for both official Hytopia game examples and custom game repositories.

## üéÆ Features

- **Dynamic Example Games**: Automatically fetches and sets up the latest official Hytopia game examples
- **Dynamic Custom Repository Support**: Add any number of your own game repositories via environment variables
- **Docker-Powered**: Containerized development environment for consistent development experience
- **Cloudflare Tunnels Support**: Optional integration with Cloudflare for remote access
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with example games
- **Flexible Setup**: Works with or without custom repositories

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hytopia-dev-kit.git
   cd hytopia-dev-kit
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. (Optional) Configure custom repositories in `.env`:
   ```env
   # Add as many CUSTOM_REPO_* entries as needed
   CUSTOM_REPO_1=https://github.com/username/repo1.git
   CUSTOM_REPO_2=https://github.com/username/repo2.git
   CUSTOM_REPO_N=https://github.com/username/repoN.git
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CUSTOM_REPO_*`: URLs for custom game repositories (use sequential numbers, e.g., CUSTOM_REPO_1, CUSTOM_REPO_2, etc.)
- `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`: (Optional) Cloudflare API token for tunnel setup
- `TUNNEL_NAME`: (Optional) Custom name for your Cloudflare tunnel
- `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`: (Optional) Your Cloudflare-managed domain for the development environment
- `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DNS_RECORD`: (Optional) DNS record for your custom domain

### Directory Structure

```
hytopia-dev-kit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/           # Dynamically populated with official examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-repos/       # Your custom repositories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/            # Docker configuration files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env              # Environment configuration
```

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Learning Hytopia Development**
   - Access official examples
   - Experiment with working game implementations
   - Learn best practices

2. **Custom Game Development**
   - Develop your own games in a controlled environment
   - Test against Hytopia's latest features
   - Collaborate with team members using Cloudflare tunnels

3. **Multi-Repository Management**
   - Work on any number of games simultaneously
   - Test interactions between different game implementations
   - Maintain separate development environments for each game

## üéÆ Multiplayer Testing

The development kit includes built-in support for multiplayer testing using Cloudflare tunnels. This allows you to:

1. **Quick Testing Setup**
   - Instantly share your game with testers
   - No need for complex networking setup
   - Automatic SSL certificate provisioning

2. **Connection Methods**
   - Direct tunnel URL access
   - Custom domain support (if configured)
   - Auto-join links for easy sharing

### Setting Up Multiplayer Testing

1. **Using Auto-generated Tunnel URL**:
   ```bash
   # Start the development environment
   docker-compose up
   ```
   The tunnel URL will be automatically generated and displayed in the console.

2. **Using Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - Configure your domain in `.env`:
     ```env
     CUSTOM_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
     CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DNS_RECORD=dev.yourdomain.com
     ```
   - Ensure your domain is managed by Cloudflare
   - The development environment will automatically configure the DNS records

### Connecting to Your Game

Players can connect to your game in two ways:

1. Via play.hytopia.com:
   ```
   https://play.hytopia.com?join=your-tunnel-url
   ```

2. Via your custom domain (if configured):
   ```
   https://dev.yourdomain.com
   ```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Example Games**
   - On startup, the system fetches the latest official Hytopia examples
   - Each example is automatically configured and made available
   - Updates are reflected when new examples are added to the official repository

2. **Custom Repositories**
   - Repositories specified in `.env` are cloned and set up
   - Each repository gets its own isolated environment
   - Changes in your repositories are reflected in real-time

3. **Multiplayer Testing Integration**
   - Automatic Cloudflare tunnel configuration
   - Custom domain setup (if configured)
   - Seamless integration with play.hytopia.com
